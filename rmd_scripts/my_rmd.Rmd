```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
data <- read.csv(here::here("data", "mtcars.csv"))
```

## My great plot 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = data, mapping = aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')
```
